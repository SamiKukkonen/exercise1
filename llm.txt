The used LLM tool : ChatGPT 4o
Motivation/reason : I was totally new to Docker and ran into some hard to understand Errors when trying to use docker-compose.
I had trouble firstly installing it and then configuring it to work in my VM environment. After researching my errors and coming up with zero solutions, I turned to ChatGPT to help me solve the root cause of the error and help me fix the issue.
How and why it helped : I think it made me realize what the problem was, usually when you are stuck with something for hours you dont realize the simple things that might be causing the issues.
What kind of mistakes did the LLM do : I only used it to solve the issue of installing docker-compose properly and configuring it to run, so I didn't run into any other issues
What were things that LLM was not able to provide : In this scenario, none.
