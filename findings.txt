Based off the work in this exercise and the research leading up to it,
I made a couple of key points that on what containers share with the host.

In this exercise service 1 and service 2 communicate with each other while being isolated from the host network. However as the port is exposed for service 1, it can be accessed through the host network.

Memory and CPU usage is shared with the host, but docker and the VM I'm using allows me to configure limits for each container.

In this exercise the containers are also isolated from the host filesystem, which is typical for containers.
